## [!!] - Before you begin will need your own GPT API Key to use Navi.

## History & Overview
Navi got its start for Alex when he was a young teen. While he does not have a direct year of refference the gameboy advance SP had just dropped as well as Megaman Battlenetwork 3. Which is where Navi takes a lot of her inspiration from. Over the many cycles leading up to this. Navi has gone from being a simple if statement based "AI" chatbot to having some models implimented that you can find out in the wild. All the way to what we see today. Navi's GPT based itteration offers all the power of GPT3.5 Davinci with some custom scripting added on to aide in various cybersec tasks.  
  
## Current Version - 0.0  
Whats implimented:
- Recon Automation Phase 1 (Nmap)  
-- Automates Nmap Scans and saves the output to a file you designate
- GPT3.5 BrainBox
- Help Menu
- A slight bit of personality

## Future Plans  
Navi is a purpose built AI, However we intend to have a lot of fun with this. On top of expanded recon automation we want to see the following: 
- Expanded recon (WhoIs, Nessus, Nuclei, Shodan to name a few)
- Inclusion of SSG's tool kit. (Cryptex, Kyber, Walla Cannon for starters) 
- Our own custom GPT Model or even our own custom trained model.
- Text to speech and voice input to give it that personal assistant feel
Quaility of life improvements:
- Commandline access from within Navi
- Getting it to pause GPT when executing custom scripts
- Better file archetecture / setup.
