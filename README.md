## üöÄ About Navi 
[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/63a04af9b14f41179b567637c4ab77a6)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/SSGorg/Navi/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

Navi was conceptualized by Alex during his formative years, with its foundational ideas rooted in the complexities of the game, Megaman Battle Network 3. From a humble beginning as a basic AI chatbot governed by rudimentary logic, Navi has matured into an advanced platform, now integrated with state-of-the-art models utilized in various digital domains.

### ü§ñ The Strategic Shift to Rasa

In September 2023, as a visionary decision by the SSG's Director, Navi underwent a transformation from the Echo framework to [Rasa](https://rasa.com/). One of the pivotal advantages of this move was Rasa's ability to enable Navi to be perpetually available. By leveraging Rasa's local host server, Navi has been seamlessly integrated as a system service, initiating automatically upon user login. This ensures that Navi is consistently on hand, ready to assist users without delay. This continuous availability, combined with enhanced training capabilities and efficient AI updates, positions Navi at the forefront of AI chatbot solutions.
