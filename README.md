## üìñ History
Navi got its start for Alex when he was a young teen. While he does not have a direct year of refference the gameboy advance SP had just dropped as well as Megaman Battlenetwork 3. Which is where Navi takes a lot of her inspiration from. Over the many cycles leading up to this. Navi has gone from being a simple if statement based "AI" chatbot to having some models implimented that you can find out in the wild. All the way to what we see today. Navi's GPT based itteration offers all the power of GPT3.5 Davinci with some custom scripting added on to aide in various cybersec tasks.  

## üóìÔ∏è Upcoming Release  
Navi is a purpose built AI, However we intend to have a lot of fun with this. On top of expanded recon automation we want to see the following: 
- Expanded recon (WhoIs, Nessus, Nuclei, Shodan to name a few)

### Future Quaility of life improvements:
- Commandline access from within Navi
- Navi history (Pressing the up arrow to cycle navi command / user's chat history)  
- Our own custom GPT Model or even our own custom trained model.
- Text to speech and voice input to give it that personal assistant feel

## üñ•Ô∏è Mac / Windows compatibility: TBA  
**Navi is built primarily for linux operating systems. However we do plan on expanding into Mac and Windows over time.**
