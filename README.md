# Navi - An AI Personal Assistant for Cyber Security
Growing up I used to love playing the megaman battle network series on my gameboy advance.  
The thought of having an AI built into a cell phone like device was always intriguing.  
At the time it was the works of SciFi but here we are with things like Siri, Google Assistant  
and Alexa at our disposal 24/7.  
  
Navi is my take on the NetNavi AI from the MMBN series while also forming it into my own ideal thing.  
Till its over I want Navi to be able to learn from its users and adapt its own personality. while of course  
helping with day to day tasks as well as helping with Cyber Security related topics such as but not limited to: 
- Threat Inteligence Monitoring
- Cyber Security Blog updates
and of course what NetNavi would be complete without the ability to do virus busting (I want to impliment anti-virus into it)

Ideally one day Navi will have its own avatar that would live in the task tray while being able to be clicked on to bring up  
the main console for chatting and doing all of its main functions. 

Thanks for checking it out, if you want to contribute. Theproject is open source.
