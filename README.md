## üöÄ About Navi | [![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/63a04af9b14f41179b567637c4ab77a6)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/SSGorg/Navi/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

Navi got its start for Alex when he was a young teen. It started with a game. Megaman Battle Network 3 which is where Navi takes a lot of its inspiration from. Over the many cycles leading up to this. Navi has gone from being a simple if statement based "AI" chatbot to having some models implimented that you can find out in the wild. All the way to what we see today.

### ü§ñ The Move to Rasa

In early September of 2023, the decision to move from Echo to [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) was made by the Director of SSG in order to bring more features forward for Navi. Including the ability to be granular with training (interactive mode) and near seamless AI updating.
