## ‚ú® **Key Features of Navi v0.5**

- **Upgraded Navi Shell** - The shell can now execute system commands, without breaking the flow of conversation. See more below!

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/63a04af9b14f41179b567637c4ab77a6)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/SSGorg/Navi/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

Navi was conceptualized by Alex during his formative years, with its foundational ideas rooted in the complexities of the game, Megaman Battle Network 3. From a humble beginning as a basic AI chatbot governed by rudimentary logic, Navi has matured into an advanced platform, now integrated with state-of-the-art models utilized in various digital domains.  

### üåç The Imperative of Open Source in AI & Cybersecurity

In the rapidly evolving domains of AI and cybersecurity, open source stands as a beacon of collaborative innovation. The transparency inherent in open-source projects offers a platform for collective problem-solving, allowing experts from diverse backgrounds to collaboratively tackle complex challenges. This communal approach accelerates advancements and ensures robustness in solutions.

For AI projects like Navi, open source provides an ecosystem where models and techniques are continually refined, reviewed, and validated by the global community. In cybersecurity, transparency is crucial. Open source tools undergo rigorous scrutiny, often leading to more secure and reliable solutions. Adopting an open-source ethos, as Navi has, aligns with the commitment to harness collective intelligence for building secure, efficient, and cutting-edge AI tools.
